                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should 
                have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe 
                bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
                infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe 
                to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from 
                pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all 
                the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning 
                of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at 
                the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
                Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the 
                signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth 
                of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. 
                Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered 
                whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent 
                discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
                realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
