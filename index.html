                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
                have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe
                bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe
                to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from
                pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
                the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at
                the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
                Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
                signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth
                of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr.
                Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
                realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.

            <h4>‘As Big as It Gets’</h4>
            <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of
                particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be
                the first direct
                observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should
                ruffle space-time.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said,
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates space and preserves a
                picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
                reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a
                set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <p> “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>

                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,”
                said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
                known as
                chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo,
                a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to
                tell him the news.

            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="col-1-3"> 
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1"></iframe>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that
                we ordered anything,
                but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island,
                Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a
                vacation,” he said.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
                astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

            </p><br>
            <p> Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
                down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
            </p><br>
            <p> John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful
                and very convincing,” he said.
