                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should 
                have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe 
                bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
                infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe 
                to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from 
                pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all 
                the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                detection, like spit in the ocean.

                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
